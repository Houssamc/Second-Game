# Second-Game
This is my 2nd basic game in Python using Pygame. It's similar to my first game but In this version I implemented very basic enemy ai movement. I learned a lot from this project happy to have more knowledge than I had going in. Tons of trial and error still got some bugs butit works and can't wait to keep building projects and learning more.
